Follow up to the DREBIN paper

This is a students project at the WU Vienna trying to replicate the [DREBIN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264785935_DREBIN_Effective_and_Explainable_Detection_of_Android_Malware_in_Your_Pocket) paper.




### Namesake
Our repository heavily revolves around the infamous [DREBIN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264785935_DREBIN_Effective_and_Explainable_Detection_of_Android_Malware_in_Your_Pocket) paper, which shares the name with a beloved Leslie Nielsen character from the filmseries "The Naked Gun". The movie lives off of slapstick and puns, much like we do.
